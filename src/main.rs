//! # NC Talk TUI Client
//!
//! Sechat-rs is a Event driven TUI for Nextcloud Talk, based on [Ratatui].
//! It uses the [Nextcloud Talk API] to communicate with a NC Server.
//!
//!
//! ## Building
//! This Project uses [cargo-make] to build and execute the different checkers.
//! Calling ```cargo make all``` is the simplest way to run all needed targets for the ci to be happy as well.
//! You might need to add the [cargo-make] crate to your system before you can build.
//!
//! Check the [Makefile] for all build targets.
//! No ```run``` make target was created since it would be a duplicate to ```cargo run```.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! You can call the client without any arguments and it will search the default XDG path for a config:
//! ```
//! cargo r
//! ```
//! Or you can pass a config file path directly. Note: The Config Arg takes a path to the folder containing the config. It expects a ```config.toml``` and a ```theme.toml``` there.
//! ``` bash
//! cargo r -- -c ~/.config/sechat-rs/
//! ```
//!
//! ## Design Considerations
//!
//! The Client is split into 3 main parts.
//! - [`Backend`] for Abstracting the NC API and Storing the NC Talk data.
//! - [`Config`] for fetching,writing and creating the config files on disk.
//! - [`UI`] for rendeing the UI and sending/controling requests to the backend.
//!
//! ### Testing and Mocking
//! For the Testing sechat-rs makes heavy use of the [`mockall`] crate. This forces the declaration of a trait type for all of the [`Backend`] structs.
//! This makes the Code for the Backend somewhat harder to read than it needs to be, but is needed in order to achieve a testability.
//!
//! ### Config
//! On Startup the ```config.toml``` and ```theme.toml``` are attempted to be read by [`config::init`].
//! If no config is found a default config is written to the location and the user is asked to fill it with the needed info.
//! If parsing of a config fails, a default config is put next to the failed one with a ```_new``` postfix.
//!
//! ### Backend
//! With the config read the [`backend::nc_talk::NCTalk`] is created, which first tries to read old chat logs from disk, and the fetches updates from the server.
//! Note: Currently gaps in the chat history are not filled automatically.
//! The `NCTalk` instance is holding a list of all [`backend::nc_room::NCRoom`]s.
//! [`backend::nc_request::nc_requester::NCRequest`] is the thread handler for the API Requests and `NCRequestWorker` does the actual request work to the API.
//! Responses are parsed using [`serde`] and various structs in [`backend::nc_request`].
//!
//! ### UI
//! The backend is then passed into a [`ui::app::App`] object and run is called which starts the UI and holds the main event loop.
//! Ether a [`crossterm::event::KeyEvent`] or the rendering timeout lead to a refresh of the UI.
//! The UI uses the [`ui::app::App`] struct to orchestrate all the UIs Widgets.
//!
